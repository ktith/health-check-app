        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="risk-category">
          <h3>What are the warning signs that I should see a doctor?</h3>
          <p>
            Seek medical attention if you experience persistent symptoms such as
            chest pain, shortness of breath, unexplained weight loss, extreme
            fatigue, frequent urination, excessive thirst, chronic cough, or any
            symptoms that concern you. For severe symptoms like chest pain,
            difficulty breathing, or sudden weakness, seek emergency care
            immediately.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="risk-category">
          <h3>Can NCDs be cured?</h3>
          <p>
            Most NCDs cannot be cured, but they can be effectively managed
            through proper treatment, lifestyle modifications, and ongoing
            medical care. Many people with NCDs live long, fulfilling lives with
            appropriate management.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="risk-category">
          <h3>How can I reduce my risk of developing NCDs?</h3>
          <p>
            You can significantly reduce your risk by adopting healthy lifestyle
            behaviors: eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables,
            engaging in regular physical activity, avoiding tobacco use,
            limiting alcohol consumption, managing stress, maintaining a healthy
            weight, and getting regular health screenings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="risk-category">
          <h3>Are NCDs hereditary?</h3>
          <p>
            While genetics can play a role in NCD risk, most NCDs result from a
            combination of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors.
            Having a family history of certain NCDs may increase your risk, but
            lifestyle choices significantly influence whether you develop these
            conditions.

        </div>

        <div class="risk-category">
          <h3>What should I do if I can't afford my medications?</h3>
          <p>
            Talk to your healthcare provider about your financial concerns.
            Options may include generic medications, patient assistance
            programs, pharmaceutical company programs, government assistance, or
            alternative treatment approaches. Never stop taking prescribed
            medications without consulting your doctor.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="risk-category">
          <h3>How often should I see my doctor if I have an NCD?</h3>
          <p>
            The frequency of medical visits depends on your specific condition,
            its severity, and how well it's controlled. Generally, people with
            NCDs should see their healthcare provider at least every 3-6 months,
            or more frequently if recommended. Always attend scheduled
            appointments and contact your doctor if you experience new or
            worsening symptoms.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="risk-category">
          <h3>Can I exercise if I have an NCD?</h3>
          <p>
            In most cases, physical activity is beneficial and recommended for
            people with NCDs. However, it's important to consult with your
            healthcare provider before starting any exercise program to
            determine appropriate activities and intensity levels for your
            specific condition.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="risk-category">
          <h3>Where can I find support groups?</h3>
          <p>
            Support groups can be found through hospitals, community health
            centers, disease-specific organizations (like the American Heart
            Association or American Diabetes Association), online platforms, and
            social media groups. Ask your healthcare provider for local
            recommendations.
