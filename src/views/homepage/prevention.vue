        <h2>The Power of Prevention</h2>
        <p>
          Many non-communicable diseases are preventable through lifestyle
          modifications and risk factor management. Research shows that up to
          80% of premature heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes cases, and
          over 40% of cancer cases, can be prevented by eliminating common risk
          factors. Prevention is not only the most effective strategy for
          reducing the burden of NCDs but also the most cost-effective approach
          for individuals and healthcare systems.
        </p>

        <div class="success-box">
          <strong>Good News:</strong> It's never too late to start making
          healthy changes. Even small improvements in lifestyle can
          significantly reduce your risk of developing NCDs and improve your
          overall quality of life.
        </div>

        <h2>Healthy Diet and Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
          A balanced, nutritious diet is one of the most powerful tools for
          preventing NCDs. What you eat directly affects your risk of developing
          cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, certain cancers, and other chronic
          conditions. A healthy diet helps maintain a healthy weight, controls
          blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and provides essential
          nutrients for optimal body function.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Dietary Recommendations:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables:</strong> Aim for at
            least 5 servings per day. These foods are rich in vitamins,
            minerals, fiber, and antioxidants that protect against NCDs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose whole grains:</strong> Replace refined grains with
            whole grain options like brown rice, whole wheat bread, oats, and
            quinoa.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Limit salt intake:</strong> Reduce sodium consumption to
            less than 5 grams per day to help prevent high blood pressure and
            reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduce sugar consumption:</strong> Limit intake of sugary
            drinks, sweets, and processed foods high in added sugars to prevent
            obesity and diabetes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose healthy fats:</strong> Opt for unsaturated fats found
            in fish, nuts, seeds, and olive oil while limiting saturated fats
            and avoiding trans fats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Moderate protein intake:</strong> Include lean meats, fish,
            legumes, and plant-based proteins in your diet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water throughout the
            day and limit sugary beverages.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
          <strong>Practical Tip:</strong> Start with small changes rather than
          overhauling your entire diet at once. Replace one unhealthy food item
          with a healthier alternative each week, and gradually build
          sustainable eating habits.
        </div>

        <h2>Physical Activity</h2>
        <p>
          Regular physical activity is essential for preventing NCDs and
          maintaining overall health. Exercise helps control weight, reduces
          blood pressure, improves cholesterol levels, strengthens bones and
          muscles, reduces stress, and improves mental health. Physical
          inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for NCD-related
          mortality worldwide.
        </p>

        <h3>Exercise Guidelines:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Adults (18-64 years):</strong> At least 150 minutes of
            moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of
            vigorous-intensity activity per week, plus muscle-strengthening
            activities on 2 or more days per week.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Older adults (65+ years):</strong> Same as adults, with
            additional focus on balance and flexibility exercises to prevent
            falls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Children and adolescents:</strong> At least 60 minutes of
            moderate to vigorous physical activity daily.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Beneficial Activities:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Aerobic exercises:</strong> Walking, jogging, swimming,
            cycling, dancing
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Strength training:</strong> Weight lifting, resistance
            bands, bodyweight exercises
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexibility exercises:</strong> Stretching, yoga, tai chi
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Balance exercises:</strong> Standing on one foot,
            heel-to-toe walking
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="success-box">
          <strong>Getting Started:</strong> If you're currently inactive, start
          slowly and gradually increase duration and intensity. Even short
          bursts of activity throughout the day add up. Take the stairs, park
          farther away, or take short walking breaks during work.
        </div>

        <h2>Tobacco Control</h2>
        <p>
          Tobacco use is one of the most significant preventable risk factors
          for NCDs. It is a major cause of cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and
          chronic respiratory diseases. Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke
          kill millions of people each year. The good news is that quitting
          tobacco use has immediate and long-term health benefits at any age.

        </ul>

        <h2>Stress Management</h2>
        <p>
          Chronic stress contributes to the development and progression of NCDs
          by affecting blood pressure, immune function, and lifestyle behaviors.
          Learning to manage stress effectively is an important component of NCD
          prevention.
        </p>

            <strong>Stay informed:</strong> Continue learning about health and
            wellness through reliable sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Be patient and persistent:</strong> Lifestyle changes take
            time; don't get discouraged by setbacks.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <div class="success-box">
          <strong>Remember:</strong> Prevention is a lifelong journey, not a
          destination. Every positive choice you make contributes to better
